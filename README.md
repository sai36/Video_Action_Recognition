# Video_Action_Recognition
Image classification is a process of classifying the image into one of the predefined
classes. One extension to this is video action recognition, which is a process of
inferring actions from video clips using attention visualization. Action recognition
has many applications in various areas like CCTV surveillance where the actions
could possibly be identified without human intervention. Attention maps are a
great boost for image classification and video action classification, as they focus
on the important regions in the image required for classification ignoring the other
regions. This greatly improves the classification accuracy. Extracting attention
maps in videos is a challenging task as the videos contain both spatial and temporal
information.
